- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidvp-dev. I'm 25 years old developer currently working for a company in Madrid creating RESTful services (API) with Mulesoft for different clients.
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain since I discovered it's potential and I'd like to build interesting solutions in this ecosystem.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and Web3 development (Hardhat, Truffle, React.js...) to create different applications and stress test those solutions searching for security vulnerabilities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Web3 project that involves a creative and useful solution to the ecosystem.
- 📫 You can reach me sending a DM on Twitter (@david_pujalte) or Discord (battanik#5627)
